We live in a cruel world, where playing sheep-panetration🐑🔙 simulator is getting boring. So I decided to start automating things like true monkey brain with a stick. Via python and dreams.

You can find so stuff in here, of various uses, mainly what I need while I play SkyBlock, OceanBlocks etc.

I use Minescript and Minescript-plus -
